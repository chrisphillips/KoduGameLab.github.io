  <helpText id="Creatable">
    <desc>
When a bot is marked as "Creatable" it then becomes special in two ways.
First, if you clone this bot then all the clones will share the same brain - changes to one will change them all.  You can see the link between creatables and their clones as dotted lines (when editing.)
Second, you can now program other bots to Create this bot complete with its programming.  This is great for arcade games where you want to continuously create enemies.
Note that this can make it easy to overrun the world's budget at which point Create will stop working.
    </desc>
  </helpText>
  <helpText id="MaxCreated">
    <desc>
For creatables, this count limits the number that can be created during gameplay. Clones that you spread about while editing don't count, this just limits the number that can be spawned by other bots with Create while playing.

The Fixed Offset option keeps the camera a fixed distance and direction from whatever object the camera is following.  This can be the cursor or a bot.  Useful for sidescrollers.

The Free option is the default and lets the camera roam free unless a bot's programming tells the camera to be in first person or to follow it.  If you're using fixed or offset camera, pressing the &lt;X&gt; button will let you set the position of the camera.
