* [Module: Kodu Curriculum Keyboard and Mouse](4_Kodu_Curriculum_Keyboard_and_Mouse.pdf)
* Student Ages: 9-14 years old
* Activity Time: 120 minutes
* Activity Level: Beginner Coder

### Prerequisites 
* Download and Installation of Kodu

### Learning Objectives
* Navigate the Kodu macro environment using a keyboard and mouse
* Understand the foundational principles of programming
* Access the programming mode of Kodu, potentially adjusting simple code for a specific purpose
* Add object, change color, select object, create text based on event, change movement based on non-event
* Create land with texture, add water, trees, rocks, etc
* Move characters using the keyboard and on their own, program object behavior, create a path that a character/object will follow
* Add characters and brainstorm and perhaps begin implementing a plot structure.
* Revise mood and tone based on strategy
* Make clones and understand the premise of Creatables
* Shift camera perspective, use close-by and far away, implement shift in behavior using pages
* Use timers, health monitors, and power ups
* Use scoring to change a behavior
