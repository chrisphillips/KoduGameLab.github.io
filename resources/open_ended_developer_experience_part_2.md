### Student Activities
[**Heading for the Finish Line**](7_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2)<br>
Introduce with Big Questions for this lesson on [Slide 2](7_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2). Students will finish their game. Emphasize the importance of having a working game that they like. Students will display their game in a Gallery Walk to the classmates in the next class lesson.
Subjects: Computer Science, Design Technology, Digital Literacy, 21st Century Learning Skills

[**The Final Production Stage**](7_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2)<br>
Introduce the plan for the Final Production, [Slide 3](7_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3). Students will finish their game by using the driver and map reader process of working on the game. Encourage students to share ideas with their neighbors and to help each other.

[**Writing Directions**](7_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3)<br>
It is important for students to be able to communicate the directions for their game to the user. Instruct students to play the game for 5 minutes and jot down things a user has to know. Students will receive guidance on how to write game instructions with [Slide 4](7_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=4). Students also have a resource in their Student Guide Activity: [Easy as One, Two, Three](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=24). Students will test their game to make sure it is working properly. Students will ensure the directions include a description that includes a goal; the directions are listed in order; the directions are short. Students will write down three things a user has to know to play your game. The teacher should model the process for writing directions in Kodu.

### Performance Expectations
Students will collaborate in sharing their games in a Gallery Walk. It is suggested that students present their work in a Gallery Walk style where students walk around the classroom, observe classmate work, and make comments with post it notes. Set the Gallery Walk in the context of visiting a museum or art gallery. Museum attendees generally walk through the exhibits in an orderly fashion along a path that ensures they will see every exhibit. Establish the process for circling the room and leaving comments to the creators prior to the walk to ensure a smooth process.
