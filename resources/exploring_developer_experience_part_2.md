### Student Activities
[**Getting Started: Review Air Delivery**]()<br>
Introduce with Big Questions for Exploring Developer Experience, Party 2 [Slide 2](4_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2). Students will explore and run the Kodu World: [Air Delivery Complete](http://worlds.kodugamelab.com/world/cNsGpAT6CU6OtEFDEyGbcQ==) Students will review the When…Do… programming constructs in Air Delivery: [Slide 3](4_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3) Students will participate in a Think-Pair-Share through guided questions: [Slide 4](4_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=4)<br>
*Subjects: Computer Science, Design Technology, Digital Literacy, 21st Century Learning Skills*

[**Collaborate Game Design**]()<br>
Students will work collaborative project to revise a complete game previously programmed, such as Flashy Fishbots, Boku’s Amazing Race, Air Delivery. The three choices for the collaborative project range from easy (Flashy Fishbots) to a bit more challenging (Boku’s Amazing Race) to the most difficult (Air Delivery). Students will need help to select the starting project to fit their needs. Students must have reasonable plans for the classroom time restraints. Students might be tempted to totally redesign the games. Students must keep their ambitions aligned to their skills and knowledge of Kodu and the time available for this project. Students will work through an iterative process of designing, testing and gathering feedback, redesigning, and finally sharing the final product. The teacher can display Let's Design a Game: [Slide 5](4_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=5). Students will receive help with the iterative process of designing, testing and gathering feedback, redesigning, and finally sharing the final product. Students should reference the Student Guide Activity: [Game Changer](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=13). Students will create and revise one of the games to include their ideas for characters and action. The teacher displays a summary slides to review games options, starting with [Slide 6](4_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=6). Students will collaborate With a partner to select one of the games to revise. Students can review possible game revisions for the game shown in the Student Guide: [Appendix](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=27). Students will sketch their first ideas in their Student Guide Activity: [Game Changer](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=13). Students will share their ideas with the rest of the class. The teacher will review possible game revisions for the game shown in the Student Guide: [Appendix](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=27). Students work collaboratively to answer the guided questions in Student Guide: [Prepare to present your game idea](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=16).<br>
*Subjects: Computer Science, Design Technology, Digital Literacy, 21st Century Learning Skills*

### Performance Expectations
[**Gather Feedback**](4_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=4)<br>
Students present to the class their ideas for their revised game. Students in the class provide ideas to the presenting team.

[**Plan Revisions**](4_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=5)<br>
After the teams present, students revise/complete their planning sketch. The teacher can display Plan Revisions: [Slide 10](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=10) Students may need to look at the various menus in Kodu to make their plans.

[**Wrap Up**](4_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=5)<br>
Students will think of a name for their game. Students will write it on their planning design. Students will share some of the best ideas they got from their peers for changing their games. Students will answer the Big Questions. [Slide 11](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=11).
