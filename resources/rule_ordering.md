## Ruler Ordering

* [Lesson plan 4: Rule ordering; Default Value idiom](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/04/lesson4.pdf)
* [Slides for module 4](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/04/slides4.pdf) and [PowerPoint source](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/04/slides4.pptx)
* Student Ages: 9-14 years old
* Activity Time: 45-60 minutes
* Activity Level: Beginner Coder

### Prerequisites 
* Download and Installation of Kodu
* [Lesson 1: Eating apples](eating_apples)
* [Lesson 2: Color Filters](color_filters)
* [Lesson 3: Indentation and scores](indentaion_and_scores) 

### Learning Objectives
* Learn indentation links to the rule above, not below.
* Learn the rule order establishes priority for conflicting actions: the lower numbered rule wins.
* Learn the rule order can be used to establish a default value for an action.
* Learn that the rule with the default value must come after the other rules for that action, so it can be overridden if one of the other rules applies.

### Student Activities
[CountFish1 Exercise: Use of Default Value idiom with "color" action](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/04/04-countfish1.pdf)<br>
Explore the Kodu World: "CountFish1". Student will play cooperatively and observe the character collision. Demonstrate learning by developing new rules to avoid collisions between the objects: kodu and flying fish. Then test the program and score points by avoiding character collision. Complete a journal activity to document and record any observations during the group activity.<br>

[Castles1 Exercise: Use of Default Value idiom with "move wander"](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/04/04-castles1.pdf)<br>  
Explore the Kodu World: "Castles1". Student will play cooperatively and observe the object: the castle. Demonstrate learning by understanding the rules of the game. Notice that if the character moves close to the object, the object may change sizes or dispense objects. The character and object must have a collision for the rules to apply. Then test the program and score points by avoiding character collision. Complete a journal activity to document and record any observations during the group activity.<br>
