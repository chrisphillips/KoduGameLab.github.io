### Student Activities
[**Getting Started: Reviewing and Tweaking Plans**](5_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2)<br>
Introduce with Big Questions for this lesson on [Slide 2](5_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2). Students will refer to the [Appendix](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=27) for any revisions in the game plans. The teacher will display Icebreaker Tweek Your Game Design Review: [Slide 3](5_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3). Students should indicate the order in which they plan to create the elements in their plan by numbering them from 1 to however many elements they have included.<br>

[**Setting the Stage**](5_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3)<br>
Students work in collaboration to begin working to finish their game. Teams should select one partner to start as the Driver (coder). The second partner will be the Map Reader (direct the coding action). The teacher can display Setting the Stage [Slide 4](5_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=4).<br>

[**Collaborative Game Development**](5_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=5)<br>
Students work in collaboration to finish their game. Itâ€™s possible that students will have elements in their plans that will require more research time than is available during the class period. Students should research examples in other Kodu games on the Kodu Game Lab Community of what they would like to include. Managing collaborative projects requires unique skills. The teacher will be more of a coach than a boss. Students will be encouraged to solve their own problems. Students will be encouraged to learn from and share ideas with peers. The teacher is to keep teams on track and to guide student decisions about what is doable in the time allowed for the project. Encourage students to build their projects in phases such that one phase is complete and functional before the next stage is attempted. When teams are done with their project, teams should complete their game by saving the game with the name selected by the team. The teacher can assist students by displaying Save My Game: [Slide 5](5_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=5). Students also can find direction for Saving My game on the Student Guide: [Saving Changes](5_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=5).<br>

### Performance Expectations
[**Wrap up: Progress Check**](5_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=5)<br>
Students review the planning document and complete the project tasks on the Progress Check [Slide 6](5_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=6) . Students also can find directions to complete the tasks in their Student Guide: [Progress Check](5_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=19). Students will check off the elements on the plan that were completed in this first development stage.
