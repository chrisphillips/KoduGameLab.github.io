[**Creating Obstacle Course Version 2**](6_Kodu_Curriculum_Math_Module.pdf#page=52)<br>
Students will open up their current game. Students will save their world, but give it a different name signifying the different version. Students will copy and paste the apples, repeating this until the number of items has doubled. Students should record the new items in their student activity sheet.

[**Creative Programming using a Template**](6_Kodu_Curriculum_Math_Module.pdf#page=52)<br>
Students will observe the teacher coding several actions. The first step by step teacher instructions includes coding When the Kodu bumps into a rock, the Kodu gets stunned. The second step by step teacher instructions includes a cannon wandering around the world. When the Kodu bumps into the cannon, the Kodu will explode and the game will end. Students will collaborate and discuss other actions/events that you would like to create in your worlds. Students will edit their worlds by using the examples learned in the demonstration.
