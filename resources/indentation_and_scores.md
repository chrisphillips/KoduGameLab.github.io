* [Slides for module 3](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/03/slides3.pdf) and [PowerPoint source](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/03/slides3.pptx)
* Student Ages: 9-14 years old
* Activity Time: 45-60 minutes
* Activity Level: Beginner Coder

### Prerequisites
* Download and Installation of Kodu
* [Lesson 1: Eating apples](eating_apples)
* [Lesson 2: Color Filters](color_filters)

### Learning Objectives
* Learn the effective range of the “eat” action.
* Learn the new idioms: “Do Two Things” and “Count Actions”
* Learn the rule indentation.
* Learn that empty WHEN predicates are always “true”.
* Learn that failing to indent a rule means its action occurs all the time.
* Learn the “score” action adds points to a score.
* Learn the “boom” action blows something up.
* Learn that the “give” action gives another character the object we are holding.

### Student Activities
[Measure1 Exercise: How far away can an object be eaten?](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/03/03-measure1.pdf)<br> 
Explore and run the following Kodu World: "Measure1". Use Critical Thinking skills to determine how far away an object can be placed away from an character and still be eaten. Use Math skills by measuring the distance from the character to the object. Use Science skills to experiment with moving the object closer to the character in order for the code to work as expected. Use collaboration skills to discuss the distance required before the character pursues the object.<br>

[HeartCannon1X Exercise: Combine Pursue and Consume with Count Actions](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/03/03-heartcannon1x.pdf)<br>
Explore and run the following World: "HeartCannon1x". Use Critical Thinking skills to combine pursue and consume with count actions. Examine the code being used on the character in the world. Use math skills to determine the number of objects the character can consume in the time constraints. Use Computer Science skills to keep a record of the objects consumed as well as control an object.<br>

[BoomPipes1 Exercise: Combine Pursue and Consume with Count Actions](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/03/03-boompipes1.pdf)<br>
Explore and run the following World: "BoomPipes1". Use Critical Thinking skills to combine pursue and consume with count actions. Examine the code being used on the character in the world. Use Math skills to determine the number of objects the character must remove. Use Computer Science skills to keep a record of the objects removed as well as control an object.<br>

[Giver1 Tips: Combine Pursue and Consume with Do Two Things](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/03/03-giver1-tips.pdf)<br>
Explore and run the following World: "Giver1". Use Critical Thinking skills to combine pursue and consume with giving objects and playing sound. Examine the code being used on the characters in the world. Use Computer Science skills to control the actions of a character. Use Music skills to play sounds that will send a character home.<br>
*Subjects: Math, Computer Science, Engineering, Music, 21st Century Learning*

[Fruit Salad Tips: Combine Pursue and Consume with Count Actions](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/03/03-fruitsalad-tips.pdf)<br> 
Start a New World. Use Critical Thinking skills to combine pursue and consume with count actions. Learners should design a space large enough for an enclosed wall, objects, and a character. Explore various colors and sizes for the objects. Use Math skills to count the calories consumed by the character.  Use Computer Science skills to have the character consume healthy calories and launch allergic objects over the wall.<br>

[Two Shooter Tips: Simple Two-Player Game](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/03/03-twoshooter.pdf)<br>
Start a New World. Use Creativity and Collaboration skills to design and compete in the world. Use Digital Technology skills to design a spiky place with an enclosed wall, objects, and two characters. Build rockets for the characters and be creative with the game rules. Explore various colors and sizes for the objects.<br>

Activity Note: If you want to replace the Gamepad with Keyboard, Mouse, follow these steps to replace Gamepad tiles:

* Gamepad with Keyboard
* Player1 with UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT 
  * L stick with Right Mouse Click
  * L trig with Left Mouse Click
* Player2 with WASD
  * L stick with Space
  * L trig with F

[Homework 3: Make a Count Actions or Do Two Things world](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/SouthFayette/hw3.pdf)<br>
Start a New World. Use Creativity and Collaboration to design a large space for four (4) character and (5) objects of various sizes. Use Computer Science skills to program a character to consume objects and play a sound after it consumes an object.<br>
