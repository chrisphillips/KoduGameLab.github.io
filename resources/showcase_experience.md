### Student Activities
[**Staging a Gallery Walk**](8_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2)
Introduce with Big Questions for this Gallery Walk lesson on [Slide 2](8_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2). Students will display their game in a Gallery Walk to their classmates. Model the process you expect. Demonstrate by walking on the prescribed path to one or two and express a “Wow” to each student on [Slide 3](8_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3).<br>

### Performance Expectations
[**Reflection**](8_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3) 
Students will participate in a Think-Pair-Share activity with the guided questions on [Slide 6](8_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=6). Students also can refer to their Student Guide Activity: [Reflection](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=26). Students will reflect on their experiences designing games with Kodu by answering the questions and placing checkmarks under the faces in the table. The teacher should modify the reflection activity to fit the student needs. Older students will be able to write about their experiences. For all students, it’s important to provide opportunities to connect recent learning with past experiences, reflect on their feelings of success, and make plans for transferring their new knowledge to future activities. For students with limited writing skills, provide some time to share their reflections verbally.
